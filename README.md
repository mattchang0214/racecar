# Computer Vision Line Following RPI Car Project

Autonomous vehicle technology has been growing at a rapid pace these few years. Major companies like Google, Tesla, and Uber are pushing the revolution for driverless vehicles to become the future of transportation. Technological advances in computer algorithms have greatly simplified the development of autonomous technology. The purpose of this project is to obtain an understanding of autonomous system development, with a combination of hardware and software challenges. The ultimate goal is to build a fully autonomous car capable of line following and object detection/avoidance. Topics explored will include navigation, computer vision, and control theory. The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B will serve as the compute board while programming will be done in Python 3.
